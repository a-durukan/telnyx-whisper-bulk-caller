# Security Summary

This document provides a security summary for the Web GUI implementation of the Telnyx Whisper Bulk Caller application.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Secret Key Management
- **Issue**: Hardcoded secret keys are a security risk
- **Solution**: Secret key is auto-generated using `secrets.token_hex(32)` or loaded from `SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Debug Mode Protection
- **Issue**: Running Flask with `debug=True` in production exposes sensitive information
- **Solution**: Debug mode is disabled by default and can only be enabled via `FLASK_DEBUG` environment variable
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) Prevention
- **Issue**: Recording URL comes from webhook data and could be manipulated
- **Solution**: Strict validation ensures URLs are from Telnyx domains only:
  - Validates hostname ends with `.telnyx.com` or equals `telnyx.com`
  - Validates scheme is `http` or `https`
  - Logs rejected attempts
  - 30-second timeout on requests
- **Status**: ✅ Mitigated (False positive - URL validation is appropriate for this use case)
- **Note**: The CodeQL alert remains because the URL comes from external input, but this is the intended application flow. The URL is validated before use.

### 4. Information Disclosure
- **Issue**: Stack traces and detailed error messages could expose implementation details
- **Solution**: 
  - Generic error messages returned to users
  - Detailed errors only logged server-side
  - Exception type logged, not full message
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 5. File Upload Security
- **Issue**: Uploaded files could have malicious names or content
- **Solution**:
  - Uses `secure_filename()` from Werkzeug
  - File type validation via extension whitelist
  - Files stored in dedicated upload directory
  - Temporary files cleaned up after processing
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 6. Exception Handling
- **Issue**: Bare except clauses catch all exceptions including system exits
- **Solution**: Use specific exception types (e.g., `OSError`, `FileNotFoundError`)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 7. API Key Storage
- **Issue**: API keys need secure storage
- **Solution**: 
  - Keys stored in local `config.json` (not committed to git)
  - `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits
  - Keys masked when displayed in UI
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented

## Known Limitations

### SSRF Alert (Accepted Risk)
**Alert**: CodeQL reports potential SSRF on line 319 of web_app.py

**Context**: This is a false positive for our use case because:
1. The URL comes from Telnyx webhook (trusted source)
2. We validate the domain is from Telnyx before making the request
3. This is required functionality - the app must download recordings from Telnyx
4. The request includes a timeout to prevent hung connections

**Mitigation**: 
- Domain validation ensures only Telnyx URLs are accessed
- URL scheme validation (only http/https)
- Timeout protection (30 seconds)
- Logging of rejected attempts

**Risk Assessment**: Low - The validation provides appropriate protection for this use case

## Security Recommendations for Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Set `SECRET_KEY` and `FLASK_DEBUG` via environment variables
2. **HTTPS**: Deploy behind HTTPS proxy (nginx, Apache) for production
3. **Firewall**: Restrict webhook endpoints to Telnyx IP ranges
4. **File Permissions**: Ensure `config.json` and result files have appropriate permissions (600)
5. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints
6. **Authentication**: For production use, add authentication (not included in this implementation)
7. **CSP Headers**: Add Content Security Policy headers for additional XSS protection

## Security Testing Performed

- ✅ CodeQL static analysis
- ✅ Manual code review
- ✅ Input validation testing
- ✅ File upload security testing
- ✅ Error handling verification
